AIR-NativeExtensions
====================

Collections of Native Extensions for Adobe AIR


### BaseExtension

This is a minimal setup with all files needed to start a new NativeExtension. It contains some scripts i've made to ease the compile and testing of ANE files.

### NativeSerial

This is a C++/C# extension that let users communicate with Serial COM Ports, like Arduino.
The lib also features COM port listing and automatic COM connection / disconnection detection.

### NativeDMXController

This extension allows you to control the Enttec DMX Pro device and communicate in both ways with DMX hardware.

### SpoutAIR

This extension lets you share a BitmapData with Spout ( see http://spout.zeal.co ) so you can use it in Processing, Resolume, Unity, etc.
